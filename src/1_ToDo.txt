- Understand why cons. overset approach gives more error
- remove assumption of 2 nodes per element
- try high order shp functions

Note: 

Conservative oveset actually has more error than just interpolating the end node. The reason for
this seems to be due to integrating twice for the overlapping elements. 

In FEM there will be an error in the interpolation of u ~ sum(NA*NB*uhat) based on the order of the shape functions. Currently we're using linear bases and trying to approximate u = exp(-x^2) so we'll get second order error in the RHS volume and flux integrals. 

When we do the conservative overset, we have to compute the volume and flux integrals twice. It seems that doing so creates a RHS that is more off than what you would get from just doing the integral once. 

Sothe solution to this may be to just skip the fringe elements on the first pass and do then go back and do just the single integral over the partial element at the end. That way I'm not doing double integration and inccuring error twice.
